# k8s-demos
A small but growing collection of Kubernetes demo scenarios

I'm regularly thrown "what if" scenarios by people looking to understand more about Kubernetes works or how Kubernetes may trip them up. The scenarios presented aren't typically complicated to set-up, but I find myself recreating them each time they come up. I've decided to capture these here, primarily to save me time, but also in the hope that others find them useful.
